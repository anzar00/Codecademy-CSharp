# Console Creatures

C# can be used to make nearly anything – even creatures! Using the Console.WriteLine() command, you can print text to the console and make anything.

You can build all kinds of ghouls with this technique.

Remember:

The backslash \ is an escape character in C#, so \" will show up as one quote in the output (") and \\ will show up as one backslash in the output (\).
Spaces matter! " (" is not the same as "(".
